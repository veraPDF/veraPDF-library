# Version 0.26 (November 16, 2016)
We've made two downloads available for out 0.26 release. There's the usual version, based on Apache PDFBox and downloadable from: http://downloads.verapdf.org/rel/verapdf-installer.zip. For 0.26 we've also prepared the first beta release of our purpose built PDF parser and validation model, also known as the greenfield validator. This is downloadable from: http://downloads.verapdf.org/gf/verapdf-gf-installer.zip. It's not functionally complete yet as it only supports PDF/A validation. Full details of the release features are listed below.

## Conformance checker
- added the new rule for embedded files to be associated with the document or its parts (PDF/A-3 only).

## Application enhancements
- first beta release of greenfield PDF/A validation available as a limited functionality app;
- refactoring of sub-component and application configuration for reproducible execution;
- new BatchProcessor producing multi-item reports;
- batch processing is stream/event driven with event handlers for processing results; and
- report structures altered to accommodate batch processing.

## Code Quality
- publication of integration tests for Greenfield components;
- memory usage and execution times in test reports;
- example test report available here at time of writing: http://tests.verapdf.org/0.26.8/

## Test corpus
- added 7 new test files to cover the new rule in PDF/A-3 validation profile

## Disabled functionality
In order to accommodate batch reporting for this release we've had to sacrifice
redirecting output to user files. This isn't permanent and will be re-instated for the next release. The following functionality has been temporarily disabled:

### Standard release
- HTML report from CLI, HTML reporting will be a function of the dedicated reporter in the next release. HTML reports are still available from the GUI;
- the -pw option that allows the user to override the profiles wiki, this was only used to generate the HTML report so is not required;
- the -c load config option, config is automatically loaded from the app area and we're adding user config to the next release;
- the --reportfile, --reportfolder, and --overwriteReportFile as these need a rethink to accommodate batch processing.

### Greenfield release
The Greenfield release is missing all of the above plus:
- metadata fixing in GUI and CLI; and
- feature extraction in GUI and CLI.

# Version 0.24 (October 11, 2016)

## Conformance checker
- added extraction of the AFRelationship key for embedded files as a part of veraPDF feature extraction.

## Application enhancements
- implemented prototype of batch validation from CLI and GUI;
- implemented robust handling of run-time exceptions during batch processing; and
- added error info on the run-time exceptions to the validation report.

## Code Quality
- moved feature extraction and metadata fixing code to library; and
- tidied various compiler warnings.

# Version 0.22 (September 7, 2016)

## Application enhancements:
- changed default feature generation to document level features
- added a new GUI dialog for managing feature generation options
- added a user-friendly Java OutOfMemoryError with suggestions for reconfiguration
- CLI can now overwrite report files
- added help message when CLI processes STDIN stream
- synchronized the Web demo validation report with the CLI and GUI report styles

## Conformance checker fixes:
- removed the rules for validating file provenance information (based on veraPDF TWG discussion)
- fixed an issue with structure type mapping in Level A validation
- implemented resource caching for memory optimization

## Test corpus:
- converted all 'fail' test cases on file provenance information to 'pass' tests

# Version 0.20 (August 1, 2016)

## Application enhancements:
- added signature types to features report;
- depth of feature reporting now configurable; and
- altered log level of some validation methods.

## Conformance checker fixes:
- fix for validation of character encoding requirements of invisible fonts; and
- fix for ICC Profile mluc tag.

## Test corpus:
- 34 new test files for PDF/A-2b.

# Version 0.18 (July 5, 2016)

This beta release provides fixes for PDF/A Validation, enhanced functionality & usability fixes for the application, and additions to the test corpus. It also marks the launch of our beta documentation site.

## Application enhancements:
- suppress all PDFBox warnings in the CLI interface when parsing PDF documents
- generate error report instead of the exception in case of broken PDF documents
