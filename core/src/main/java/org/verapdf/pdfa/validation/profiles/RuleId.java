 * <li>a {@link Specification} instance that identifies the particular PDF/A
 * specification referenced.</li>
 * <li>a String clause identifier, for the PDF/A specifications clauses are
 * identified by a sequence of period separated integers, e.g 6.1.3, that

 * <li>an int test number, many specification clauses are further sub-divided
